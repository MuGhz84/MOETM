### [](#description)Description

MOETM:-\
1. The MOETM, is an automated business process model discovery (ABPD) algorithm.
2. This is the implementation of the discovery algorithm originally proposed in the publication (Multi-Objective Optimization for Automated Business Process Discovery).

3. The algorithm takes a raw event-log file as its only input, and its output is a collection of mutually non-dominating process models (a Pareto Front approximation set).
